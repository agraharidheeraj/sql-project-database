## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate SQL skills by querying and analyzing IPL data stored in a PostgreSQL database. It covers a range of questions related to match results, player awards, economy rates, and other statistics from different IPL seasons.

## Data Sources

The data used for this project is sourced from an IPL database. The database contains tables such as `matches` and `deliveries`, which store match information and ball-by-ball details of each match. The database schema may include other tables that are not covered in this project.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `ipl_query.sql`: SQL queries that answer specific questions about IPL data.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## SQL Queries

The project contains several SQL queries that answer questions related to IPL data. These queries are well-documented and provide insights into various aspects of IPL matches and player performance. The queries cover topics such as economy rates, player awards, toss-winners, and more.

## Usage

To run the SQL queries, you need to have access to a PostgreSQL database containing the IPL data. You can use a tool like `psql` to execute the queries:

```bash
psql -U your_username -d your_database_name -a -f queries.sql
